# Introduction
Welcome to Integra Api! The main goal for this api is to ease the communication between the terminal and the POS.
This is possible by using requests, responses and status updates for a more simple understanding of the communication.
It is available to both Java and .NET. This API is targeted to the POS developers who want to integrate with 
3c payment equipment.
